## Project Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the famous Titanic disaster dataset. The primary goal is to uncover the characteristics that influenced a passenger's survival. Through various visualizations and statistical analyses, we aim to understand the complex interplay of factors like age, gender, passenger class, and family size in determining who lived and who perished.

## Problem Statement

What characteristics (like age, gender, passenger class, etc.) influenced survival the most during the Titanic disaster?

## Key Features & Analysis

* **Data Loading & Initial Inspection:** Loading the dataset and performing initial checks for missing values, data types, and basic statistics.
* **Univariate Analysis:** Examining distributions of individual features (e.g., Age distribution, Passenger Class counts).
* **Bivariate Analysis:** Exploring relationships between two variables, particularly focusing on how different features correlate with the 'Survived' status (e.g., Survival by Gender, Survival by Passenger Class).
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Investigating the impact of multiple features on survival simultaneously (e.g., Age, Gender, and Class combined effect on survival).
* **Correlation Analysis:** Visualizing the correlation matrix to understand relationships between all numerical features.
* **Insight Generation:** Deriving meaningful conclusions and insights from the visualizations to answer the problem statement.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
* Matplotlib (for basic plotting)
* Seaborn (for advanced statistical visualizations)

## Getting Started

To run this notebook locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Titanic-EDA.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Titanic-EDA.git)
    cd Titanic-EDA
    ```

2.  **Install necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4.  Open the `titanic_eda_project.ipynb` file from the Jupyter interface.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the well-known Titanic dataset, commonly available on platforms like Kaggle. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their survival status, age, gender, passenger class, fare, and more.

## Insights & Conclusions

(This section will contain the summarized insights derived from your EDA, similar to what we discussed earlier, e.g., "Gender was a paramount factor for survival, with women having significantly higher odds...", "Lower passenger classes, especially Pclass 3, experienced drastically reduced survival rates...", etc.)
